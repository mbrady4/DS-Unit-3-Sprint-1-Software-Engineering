### Part 7 - Questions and Answers

Acme Corporation isn't just a few `.py` files. If you want to grow in your
career here, you'll have to answer the following:

*What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
when others do the same for your code?*

- In my opinoin, a code review serves multiple important purposes. First, code reviews breakdown knowledge silos, helping to **ensure that multiple people understand the code** deeply. Second, code reviews **help teams maintain consitent style and documentation standards**. Without consistent reviews, individual team members are more apt to overlook documentaiton and possibly abandon stylistic guidelines. Third, **code reviews offer a chance to improve the logic of the code.** The reviewer may be able to offer an alternative approach or may ask a question that triggers a breakthrough. 

*We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
improve this situation?*

- Containers create the ability to build and execute software in isolated operating environments (separated from the computer's operating system). Critically, containers enable the exact same isolated operating environment to be recreated across computers regardless of the underlying computer's operating system and settings. **Essentially, adopting containers would enable Acme corporation to worry less about specific operating environments on individual computers and more on the development and execution of software.**
